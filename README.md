# forcebotti
python chat bot for twitch

I'm not focusing that much on making the bot accessible to everyone, I just make it mainly for myself and upload new versions here when I feel like they have significantly improved from the last version.

The bot is designed to run on my Raspberry Pi, so there are some Pi specific things in the code.

If you need any help or have any questions about the bot I am happy to help, contact me: whisper "finnishforce_" in twitch or add me in Steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnishForce/ or just contact through github if you aren't in a hurry.
